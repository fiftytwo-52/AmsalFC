PROJECT BRIEF: AMSAL FC MULTI-LEVEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Admin: Can add/remove players, update news, and manage the live match score.

Super Admin: Can do everything an Admin does, PLUS add/remove other Admin accounts and manage "Admin Profiles."

3. TECH STACK (NO-AI IMPLEMENTATION)

Runtime: Node.js

Framework: Express.js

Real-time: Socket.io (For instant news and score updates)

Storage: Local JSON files (admins.json, members.json, news.json)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS via CDN), Vanilla JavaScript

Profile Management: Each admin can update their own "Admin Profile" (Display Name, Bio).

C. Super Admin Features (The "Everything" Controller)

Admin Management: A dedicated page to create new Admin accounts (Username/Password) or delete existing ones.

System Overlook: Ability to edit or delete any content posted by any other admin.

7. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AI AGENT

"Act as a Full-Stack Developer. Build the AMSAL FC system using Node.js and Vanilla JS. Follow these steps:

Setup: Create the folder structure and initialize server.js with Express and Socket.io.

Data: Create functions to Read/Write to the three JSON files in /data.

Authentication: Implement a simple session-based login. Create one hardcoded 'Super Admin' account to start.

APIs: Build routes for /api/members, /api/news, and a special /api/admin-management for the Super Admin.

UI: Ensure the 'Left-Center-Right' navbar is strictly followed. Use Tailwind CSS to make the Admin panels look like a modern 'Management Dashboard'.

Logic: Ensure all 'Add/Remove' actions update the JSON files immediately so no data is lost."
